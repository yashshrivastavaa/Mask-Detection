## :star: Features
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it‚Äôs also¬†computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://github.com/yashshrivastavaa/Mask-Detection-Security/tree/main/dataset)

This dataset consists of¬†__3339 images__¬†belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1755 images__
*	__without_mask: 1584 images__

## üîë  Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/yashshrivastavaa/Mask-Detection-Security/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## üöÄ  Installation
1. Clone the repo
```python
$ git clone https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo 
```python
$ cd Face-Mask-Detection
```
3. Create a Python virtual environment named 'test' and activate it
```python
$ virtualenv test
```
```python
$ source test/bin/activate
```

4. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```python
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## üí° Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command:
```python
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in an image type the following command: 
```python
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```python
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
